Final project analyzing all loans issued from 2007 to 2015 via LendingClub, the worldâ€™s largest peer-to-peer lending company. The dataset can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data/data.

We used Anaconda Spyder environment to execute. Please note that we have also provided the Jupyter Notebook file which includes output, i.e. visualizations, from our presentation.

The code relies on numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, plotly, seaborn, tensorflow, and sklearn. The specific modules are below (and are also imported into memory upon execution):
