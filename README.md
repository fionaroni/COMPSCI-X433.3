import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import normaltest, anderson, shapiro
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly
plotly.offline.init_notebook_mode()
import seaborn as sns
import tensorflow as tf
import sklearn
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
from sklearn import preprocessing
from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize
from tensorflow.contrib.factorization import KMeans
